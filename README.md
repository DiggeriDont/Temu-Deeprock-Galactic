# Gameplan

## Theme 
### Title(WIP): Temu Deep rock galactic 


# Gameplay loop
1. You spawn in you and/or your companies ship
2. From this ship you can craft things, purchase things, move the ship to predesignated locations which costs some fuel or something. 
3. You can also choose to select a mission (or mining job)
4. After selecting a job you descend to the job location and MUST gather a certain amount of resources before you are able to return to your ship. 
    - return is not required upon gathering these resources and players may choose to stay and scavenge further.
5. Exfil from your job location back to the ship
6. Repeat


# Phase 1 - Ready for testing

- Enemies
    - Pathfinding for enemies. 
        - Can crawl onn walls and ceilings 
        - Can function as hoard, or at least appear to do so. 
        - Mob prevention (e.g. 10 of them can't gang up on you at once). 
        - Able to pick spawn points of enemies (possibly within the bounds of generation)
        - Melee and ranged types (eventually) damage movement speed/attack speed needs to be balances

- Terrrain Generation
    - Surface exists, nothing to do there (for now). Barren sand storm in the distance so theres not much to see or do. Hole in the ground invites you down. 
    - Prefab terrain blocks with minor detailing that has room for some procedural generation. 
        - There should be at least 20 of these prefabs which are able to connect at near random with a minimum and maximum area covered.
        - Verticality in the caves. 
        - Some maps should look like they've been visited before or lived in (abandoned mining site or maybe even a civilization)
        - Random check for whether it's previsited with a loot table that is contingent on this. 
        - Buidlings for the interior need to be constructed. 
        - 

- Weapons system 
    - For melee and ranged, particular emphasis on melee. 
    - 3rd or first person. ADS For ranged, F or right click for block on melee
    - OPENENDED FOR NOW

- Mining mechanic
    - (for NOW) click, click, stuff. Like tradelands 

- Datastore 
    - Your ship is custom. everything pertaining to that needs to be saved
    - Your character has a plethora of data. Maybe currency, definitely inventory.
    - Ship has a shared inventory which must save


# Phase 2 - Ready for beta
- Loot Table
    - Different loot tables for drops/crates around the map and mining with mining being higher tier loot drops

- Building system
    - Prefab structures with a customizable interior

- Crafting system 
    - UI for the crafting system. 

- Lights on your suit that are (almost) required to see.
    - Batteries fuel this. 
    - Batteries should be rarer than parts to craft one. 
    - At the start 


- Research tree for progression 
    - Takes different resources from your ship to craft items. 

- Maximum Inventory space
