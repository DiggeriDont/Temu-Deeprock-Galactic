### Title(WIP): Temu Deep rock galactic 


# Phase 1

- Pathfinding for enemies. 
    - Can crawl onn walls and ceilings 
    - Can function as hoard, or at least appear to do so. 
    - Mob prevention (e.g. 10 of them can't gang up on you at once). 

- Terrrain Generation
    - Surface exists, nothing to do there (for now). Barren sand storm in the distance so theres not much to see or do. Hole in the ground invites you down. 
    - Prefab terrain blocks with minor detailing that has room for some procedural generation. 
        - There should be at least 20 of these prefabs which are able to connect at near random with a minimum and maximum area covered.
        - Verticality in the caves. 
        - Some maps should look like they've been visited before or lived in (abandoned mining site or maybe even a civilization)
        - Random check for whether it's previsited with a loot table that is contingent on this. 
        - Buidlings for the interior need to be constructed. 
        -
